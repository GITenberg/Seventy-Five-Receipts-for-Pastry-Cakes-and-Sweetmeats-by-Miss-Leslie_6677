description: '"Eliza Leslie''s Seventy-five Receipts for Pastry, Cakes, and Sweetmeats
  was the first distinctively baking cookbook published in America, as well as the
  first to share ingredients in a systematic list order at the beginning of each recipe.
  As Eliza recorded at the time of initial publication, "All the ingredients, with
  their proper quantities, are enumerated in a list at the head of each receipt, a
  plan which will greatly facilitate the business of procuring and preparing the requisite
  article.""--Amazon.com, viewed June 5, 2013.'
